// This file defines class "Reader".

// This code uses
//      class Semaphore, from the java.util.concurrent package in Java 5.0 which defines the behaviour of a 
//                           semaphore, including acquire and release operations.
//      class Synch, which defines the semaphores and variables 
//                   needed for synchronizing the readers and writers.
//      class RandomSleep, which defines the doSleep method.
